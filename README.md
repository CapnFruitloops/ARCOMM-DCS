ARCOMM DCS Missions 

All missions are named with the same format, which is as follows:

ARC_$$(####)_YYYYMMDD

$$ - The weather preset selected for the missions, ie. Broken 4 = B4 or Overcast Rain 1 = OR1  
(####) - The time selected for mission start, ie. 0400, 1000, 2000, etc.  
YYYYMMDD - The date the mission was last edited, ie. 20220418

For any requests in the missions or for issues, open a new issue request with as much info as possible.  
All requests will be handled as quick as possible, also feel free to @ fruitloops in the ARCOMM discord to let me know you've submitted one, or even DM me directly.
